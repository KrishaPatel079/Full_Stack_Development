    category: "Arrays",
    difficulty: "Easy",
    answer: "Use a hash map to store complements",
    explanation: "We can solve this in O(n) time by using a hash map. For each number, we check if its complement (target - number) exists in the map. If it does, we've found our pair.",

    title: "Valid Parentheses",
    questionText: "Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if: Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.",
    category: "Strings",
    difficulty: "Easy",
    answer: "Use a stack to track opening brackets",
    explanation: "We can use a stack to keep track of opening brackets. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if it matches the most recent opening bracket.",

    difficulty: "Easy",
    answer: "Use three pointers to reverse links",
    explanation: "We can reverse a linked list by iteratively changing the next pointer of each node to point to the previous node. We need three pointers: previous, current, and next.",
